<span style="color:black">The "Dots-On-A-Sphere Synthesizer is a small Javascript experiment using both ThreeJs and ToneJS to create a synthesizer that doubles as a music visualizer. The dots are equidistantly arranged using the Fibonacci Lattice algorithm and connected via convex hull. The number of points on the sphere can be changed using the menu, but is limited to the range from 3 to 128. Any less than three and the synthesizer would no longer have shape and any more than 128 then the notes will go outside of the range usually seen on a keyboard. The synthesizer can also read MIDI files, as shown with the example of Claude Debussy's Clair de Lune.</span>
