###### <span style="color:black">Christian Lee</span>
Based in New York, NY 

<span style="color:black">I was born in Irving, Texas before I moved to northern Virginia where I spent most of my early life. There, I discovered my interests in software engineering, fashion, and sports. In 2012 I began to get into the world of clothes archiving and reselling, but wouldn't further develop a more serious interest until later. Throughout highschool, I quickly developed a very serious penchant towards computer science and programming, and I went on to develop software for my highschool, win some hackathons, and work at a startup all before I graduated.</span>

<span style="color:black">In 2016 I moved to New York City to study Computer Science at New York University and found work at Amazon as a software engineer. During my studies, I found a passion for making music and added a heavy music and arts work into my courseload, including classes such as \[Music, the Mind, and Artificial Intelligence\], \[Fashion in Context\], and \[Machines Made of Words\]. I've performed my music at multiple shows in NYC and developed an archive of roughly ~$15,000 of rare vintage and avante-garde clothing, which I've sold to multiple high-profile celebrities such as Drake and Yung Bans.</span>

<span style="color:black">During NYFW FW2019, I was approach by a lead scout from Strong Worldwide to come to a casting for a NYFW show. Since then, I've shot with many more photographers, brands, and agencies during my stay in NYC and have had a wonderful time exploring the world of modeling. Around this time, as much as I enjoyed being in front of the camera, I also grew an interest in being behind the camera as a photographer. I shoot primarily on 35mm film and shoot a combination of portraits and landscapes.</span>

<span style="color:black">After my graduation in May 2020, I will continue to explore the world of music, modeling, and photography while working as a software engineer for Amazon in New York City.</span>
