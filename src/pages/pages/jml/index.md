###### <span style="color:black">jazzML</span>

<span style="color:black">JazzML is a small, ongoing experiment to see if I could use machine learning to have my computer create jazz piano solo compositions. Using a few python scripts, I gathered and parsed hundreds of jazz piano solo performance MIDI files and ran them through a recurrent neural network using Google's Magenta library for Tensorflow. You can see an example of a checkpoint result after one night of training.</span>
