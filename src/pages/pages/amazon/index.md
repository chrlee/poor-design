###### <span style="color:black">Amazon</span>

<span style="color:black">Since 2018 I've been working with Amazon.com as a software development engineer. During the summer of 2018 I worked in Seattle, WA at the Amazon headquarters under Amazon Business to help develop and publish Amazon Business's public Reporting API. This allowed companies using Business Prime to track their orders, spending, shipments, etc. using the Reporting API or its Alexa counterpart.

<span style="color:black">In the summer of 2019 I worked under Amazon Advertising in New York City as one of the first members of the International Expansion team. At the time, since advertising was a relatively newer business in the Amazon ecosystem, Amazon Advertising was having a hard time keeping up with Amazon Retail in launching into new marketplaces. In order to counteract this, I helped design and develop an internal tool that allowed for rapid expansion into new marketplaces, reducing the org-wide engineering effort from ~7 months to ~1 month per new marketplace.
